    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to fit closed interval [0; 1]. I've calculated min with followed by substraction and division by maximum. At the end of procedure all pictures lay down in range [0...1] with some channel pixels achives 0 value and 1 value. This procedure should help to improve contrast on light or dark colored pictures but keep color channels proportions close to original picture\n",

    "I didn't use grayscale convertion becouse I do believe colors should help to detect sign features. If we use it for our own sight why should we drop it for machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aswell I don't use any artificial data. Only normalization and full color spectrum usage gave me enough information to achieve near 0.95 accuracy on validation set. \n",

The architecture ables to extract features even with small and noisy pictures. LeNet shows good result to process geometry features to classify signs at the end of network pipeline.\n",
    "* LeNet is small but working solution, could be trained really fast due simple architecture. Easy to modificate and experiment. \n",
    "* LeNet provided good results with validation accuracy of 0.962 and test set accuracy of 0.942. There is still some ways to improve network potential with data augmentation and alignment of number of examples per class. Implementaion of these techniques could help to achieve better result without any new raw data.\n",
